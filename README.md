# Mandelbrot-Set-Visualization

This project is a java application that visualizes the Mandelbrot Set using the swing library. The color mapping is based on the number of iterations required for each point to escape the set. 

The display can be customized by changing the following parameters: width, height, maxIterations, lowerRange, and upperRange.
